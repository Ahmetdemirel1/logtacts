Howdy!

You asked to be reminded about summing up your day's meetings in Contact Otter. 
We find it helpful to take a moment out of the day to log:

- Meetings with people you know (How are they doing, anyway?)
- New people you meet (Did you remember to ask their favorite ice cream flavor?)
- Conversations or notes about the people in your life (Birthdays are always great to remember!)

https://www.contactotter.com is ready when you are to keep your network organized!

Cheers,
The Otters
