Contact Otter
=============

Contact Otter is an address book with logging for individuals, families, or 
small-to-medium teams. We like to think of it as a "personal CRM". It features:

- Ability to add, edit, and tag contacts
- Custom field creation
- Search across contacts and tags
- Adding logs to contact (like sending them an email, etc)
- Exporting emails and addresses to CSV
